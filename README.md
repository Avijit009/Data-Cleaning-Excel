# Data-Cleaning-and-Creating-Dashboard-Excel

1. Data Cleaning: I reviewed the dataset to identify and remove any duplicate entries to ensure data accuracy.

2. Standardization: I converted the abbreviations in the "Marital Status" and "Gender" columns to their full forms for better clarity.

4. Data Visualization: After cleaning and standardizing the data, I created several visualizations to represent key insights.
